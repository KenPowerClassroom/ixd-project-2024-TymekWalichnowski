                engaging is the app? Is it 
                visually appealing? Does 
                it have sound and 
                animation to capture the 
                user's attention? Does it 
                have a good balance of 
                challenge and reward? </td>
            <td>Scratch is very engaging due
                to the fact that the user can
                make their own games very easily,
                there are no built-in sounds or animations
                but the site itself and editor is very visually
                appealing with how blocks of code are put together. (8/10)
            </td>
            <td>Kahoot is incredibly engaging due to the way it uses gamificiation elements,
                students must engage in competitive quizes with one another.
                Answering faster gets more points, the music is very catchy and build tension
                and it is aesthetically pleasing with its simple aesthetics. (9/10)
            </td>
            <td>The app is engaging due to how it gamifies typing,
                it uses typing sounds and animation to capture the user's attention?
                and it has a good balance of increasing challenge that makes users want to improve,
                along with having "exp" and "levels" to incentivise use.

                well does the app track  
                the user's progress? Does 
                it provide feedback and 
                recommendations to help 
                users improve their 
                performance? Does it use 
                data to personalize the 
                learning experience </td>
            <td>Scratch doesn't track user progress or
                provide feedback, nor does it use data to personalize the
                learning experience. It is hands-off and up to the user to
                track their own progress by looking at their own gallery. (2/10)
            </td>
            <td>A total leaderboard is shown at the end of quizes 
                but there is no way to track your progress, nor does it give feedback
                to the user on how to improve. (1/10)</td>
            <td>The application does an excellent job at tracking user progress
                with the exp and level system, showcasing a user's general progress,
                while the Average Typing Speed, Accuracy and Time stats act as very strong
                goal-posts. It does not have any personalised plans, however. (8/10)

                Is it easy to navigate and  
                use? Does it have clear 
                instructions and 
                prompts? Does it have a 
                well-designed interface? </td>
            <td>Scratch  is very user-friendly as it is able to
                simplify something as complicated as coding
                into a very simple block/puzzle formula that is very clear
                on how it works. The interface is also clear and easy to understand.
                It could use some built-in tutorials, however. (8/10)
            </td>
            <td>The app is very easy to use, hence why it is such a staple
                in classroom environments. There are clear instructions and
                prompts for the students and they should know exactly what to do at
                any moment. (10/10)
